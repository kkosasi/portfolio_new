    <h3>How did I get into design?</h3>
    <br>
<h5>I've always been an artist, but the concept of digital design didn’t come into my life until high school.
In time of curiosity, I joined the Graphic Design class to fill in my empty schedule. Still didn’t understood
it in the beginning, but I fell in love with it in college where I decided to pursue it full time. Design is a way
for me to communicate clearly through art. It is not ambiguous and left to interpretation. It is a way to
touch emotions, and waver hearts through visual communication. The creativity of marketing that is
involved in design drives my passion. I strive to keep clarity of communications in my designs.
</h5><br><br>
<h3>What kind of work environment do I thrive in and where do I see myself in 5 years?</h3>
<br>
<h5>A place where I can be myself, exercise and grow my design skills. An upbeat, friendly, and breathable
work culture is important for me. Having someone to learn from is also a great plus! In the next 5 years
I would love to learn 3D modeling, and doing UI/UX full time in a non-office environment. I would love to
continue doing remote work due to it being environmentally friendly, and it saves time from commuting.
During the pandemic I realized that the set up I have at home is a lot faster, creating a more efficient work
progress. Mentally, I had actual spare time to take extra classes, care for my dogs, hike, go to the doctor,
and have time for a healthier lifestyle due to being in the comfort of my home. I want to use my creativity
thoroughly in an active work environment. Being the jack of all trades is a my end goal as a designer.
I would love to be able to be the person who can do-it-all.
</h5><br><br>
<h3>What am I currently doing to improve my skills?</h3>
<br>
<h5>I am currently enrolled in a UI/UX bootcamp program in order to boost my career, skills, experience and
knowledge in the field. I am hoping to go into this route in the design world in the future.</h5>

    <h3>My love for adventure:</h3>
    <br>
    <h5>Travelling is one of my biggest passion in life and I'd like to continue doing so before it drags me to settle down.
    I don’t plan on stopping because these explorations and adventures have inspired, educated, and pushed me in
    ways that I can’t begin to imagine. It has affected my views of their society, culture, food and lives, and also, my
    design inspirations. Exploration and adventure of experiencing other cultures are exciting!</h5>
